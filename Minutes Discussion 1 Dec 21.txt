Amelia
- The Facing should be a feature should have high variance however there is not much difference
	- e.g Within South West in Sebawang it would be lower than the prices in Bishan

- Compare against another feature, facing vs district for example (feature engineering)

Sze Kong
- Variance for the scrapped data is not significant enough
- Exploring on the possibility of Distance to MRT as a feature

- Can do two models and then see which one is better

Cheryl
- Dataset does not tell us the information that we are looking for. 
	- No variance in the dataset so it might not be helpful

Rachel
- Concerned on missing data , should we drop it?, run with two dataset set? One with about 1 thousand and another
one with empty values.


Randy
 - Issue with missing values
	- Unable to Proceed without dropping these features

Conclusion: Switched to HDB Gov dataset
